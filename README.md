# LGMVIP-Java-Task-1
This code creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game with a GUI. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and players take turns clicking on buttons to place their marks (either "X" or "O"). The game checks for a winner after each move, and if a winner is found, it displays a message dialog announcing the winner and resets the game.
